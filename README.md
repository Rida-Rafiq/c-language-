# c-language-
A collection of C language programs and cybersecurity practice as I learn the fundamentals of secure coding and system-level programming.
# Cybersecurity Learning in C

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is a part of my journey as a Computer Science student exploring the world of **Cybersecurity** and learning the **C programming language**. Here, you'll find basic to intermediate C programs focused on system-level programming, memory management, and security concepts.

---

## 🔐 What This Repo Covers

- Basics of C programming  
- Secure coding practices  
- Working with memory (stack/heap)  
- Buffer overflows (for learning purposes only)  
- Input validation and sanitization  
- File handling in C
- Simulated vulnerability labs and exercises

---

## 📚 Why C for Cybersecurity?

C is close to the hardware and gives low-level access to memory, making it ideal for understanding how exploits like buffer overflows and memory corruption work. It's a foundational language for learning **ethical hacking**, **exploit development**, and **reverse engineering**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Linux terminal / WSL / Ubuntu
- GDB (GNU Debugger)
- Valgrind (for memory debugging)

---

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This repository is for **educational purposes only**. Any vulnerabilities or exploits shown here are meant to improve understanding of cybersecurity concepts in a controlled and ethical manner.

---

## 📈 Future Plans

- Add more examples on system calls
- Practice basic cryptography in C
- Implement a simple port scanner
- Document secure vs insecure coding patterns

---

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a Computer Science student passionate about cybersecurity and low-level programming. Follow my journey here as I continue to build my skills in C and security!
